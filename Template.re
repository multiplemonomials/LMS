Fine piece! You finished the Statue of a Female Mercenary!
--------------
The northern lands are poor and unfit for farming, so a lot of northern women become mercenaries to protect their homes and earn some money. They never retreat and always finish their assigned tasks.
With weapons in their hands they fearlessly slay the most dangerous monsters of the north! Ever since knights became too arrogant, the peacekeeping duty fell on mercenariesâ€™ shoulders.
